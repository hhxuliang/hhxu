/*
 * INET		An implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite for the LINUX
 *		operating system.  INET is implemented using the  BSD Socket
 *		interface as the means of communication with the user level.
 *
 *		SOCK - AF_INET protocol family socket handler.
 *
 * Version:	@(#)sock.c	1.0.17	06/02/93
 *
 * Authors:	Ross Biro, <bir7@leland.Stanford.Edu>
 *		Fred N. van Kempen, <waltje@uWalt.NL.Mugnet.ORG>
 *		Florian La Roche, <flla@stud.uni-sb.de>
 *
 * Fixes:
 *		Alan Cox	: 	Numerous verify_area() problems
 *		Alan Cox	:	Connecting on a connecting socket
 *					now returns an error for tcp.
 *		Alan Cox	:	sock->protocol is set correctly.
 *					and is not sometimes left as 0.
 *		Alan Cox	:	connect handles icmp errors on a
 *					connect properly. Unfortunately there
 *					is a restart syscall nasty there. I
 *					can't match BSD without hacking the C
 *					library. Ideas urgently sought!
 *		Alan Cox	:	Disallow bind() to addresses that are
 *					not ours - especially broadcast ones!!
 *		Alan Cox	:	Socket 1024 _IS_ ok for users. (fencepost)
 *		Alan Cox	:	sock_wfree/sock_rfree don't destroy sockets,
 *					instead they leave that for the DESTROY timer.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Clean up error flag in accept
 *		Alan Cox	:	TCP ack handling is buggy, the DESTROY timer
 *					was buggy. Put a remove_sock() in the handler
 *					for memory when we hit 0. Also altered the timer
 *					code. The ACK stuff can wait and needs major 
 *					TCP layer surgery.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Fixed TCP ack bug, removed remove sock
 *					and fixed timer/inet_bh race.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Added zapped flag for TCP
 *		Alan Cox	:	Move kfree_skb into skbuff.c and tidied up surplus code
 *		Alan Cox	:	for new sk_buff allocations wmalloc/rmalloc now call alloc_skb
 *		Alan Cox	:	kfree_s calls now are kfree_skbmem so we can track skb resources
 *		Alan Cox	:	Supports socket option broadcast now as does udp. Packet and raw need fixing.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Added RCVBUF,SNDBUF size setting. It suddenely occured to me how easy it was so...
 *		Rick Sladkey	:	Relaxed UDP rules for matching packets.
 *		C.E.Hawkins	:	IFF_PROMISC/SIOCGHWADDR support
 *	Pauline Middelink	:	Pidentd support
 *		Alan Cox	:	Fixed connect() taking signals I think.
 *		Alan Cox	:	SO_LINGER supported
 *		Alan Cox	:	Error reporting fixes
 *		Anonymous	:	inet_create tidied up (sk->reuse setting)
 *		Alan Cox	:	inet sockets don't set sk->type!
 *		Alan Cox	:	Split socket option code
 *		Alan Cox	:	Callbacks
 *		Alan Cox	:	Nagle flag for Charles & Johannes stuff
